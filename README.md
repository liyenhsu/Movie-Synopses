# Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling for Movie Synopses

### Objective
In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster synopses of [Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time from IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls055592025/) into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

### Data
A list of the 100 movies and their synopses from IMDB and Wikipedia are in [data](data).

### Results
Data processing and modeling are shown in [Document_Clustering.ipynb](Document_Clustering.ipynb).
